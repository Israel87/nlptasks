Based on the existing open-source framework (Rasa which is an open-source conversational AI framework) used built for the implementation of this work, the third and the fourth step can be as one but for clarity and the peculiarities of the framework, it is necessary to have a standalone fourth step that also connects with the database to retrieve the generated intents to be used as its training data, build a corresponding model off it and then evaluate the precision and accuracy of the model.

The concept of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment forms the final step in this work based on the constant evaluation of the model, the feedback from users of this work, and the test results from Quality Assurance specialists who review the application and cite several test cases to optimize the application and as shown from the architectural design in Figure 3.1, there is repeat symbol which implies that the Rasa application will continuously refine the models using the implementation from its repositories of algorithms outside the scope of this work and then deploy to the appropriate server or code repository with versions and the capabilities of rollbacks if necessary.
